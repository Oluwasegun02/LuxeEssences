# Python on Replit

This is a template to get you started with Python on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

## Running the repl

1. Setup a new secret environment variable (the lock icon) where the key is `SECRET_KEY` and the value is
   a randomly generated token of 32 bits of randomnese. To generate such a token type this into the shell and hit Enter:
```
python
import secrets
secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
```

## Installing packages

To add packages to your repl, you can just import directly in the file you want to use the package in, and it will automatically be installed when you press the run button. Like below:
```python
import math
import pandas as pd
```

You could also install packages by using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar.
